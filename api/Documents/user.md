Got it! To ensure that data is tied to specific users and only affects their own data in your fitness app, here are the **steps** to update your code:

---

### **Steps**:

1. **Add User Association to Models**:
   - Update your `Routine`, `Exercise`, and other relevant models to include a `UserId` property (foreign key) to associate data with specific users.

2. **Authenticate Users**:
   - Implement user authentication (e.g., using JWT, OAuth, or Identity) to identify which user is making the request.

3. **Authorize Requests**:
   - Add authorization checks to ensure that users can only access or modify their own data.

4. **Filter Data by `UserId`**:
   - Modify queries to filter data by the authenticated user's `UserId` (e.g., `where routine.UserId == userId`).

5. **Modify Controllers**:
   - Ensure that all `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` operations explicitly use the `UserId` to scope the data to the authenticated user.

6. **Handle Multi-Tenant Database Setup (Optional)**:
   - If you plan to support multiple organizations, consider a multi-tenant design to isolate user data further.

7. **Test for Data Isolation**:
   - Verify that users can only access and modify their own data through unit and integration tests.
