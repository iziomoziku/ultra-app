### Revised Deployment Steps (Simplified for One Live Environment Without Docker)

1. **Set Up Hosting Environment**  
   - Choose a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku).  
   - For this project, Azure is the selected provider.

2. **Configure Database**  
   - Set up a single production database on Azure.  
   - Configure the database connection string in the backend's `appsettings.json`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   - Add necessary production environment variables (e.g., connection strings, JWT keys) in the Azure App Service configuration.

4. **Deploy Backend**  
   - Deploy the backend (ASP.NET Core API) to the Azure App Service using code-based deployment.

5. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Build and deploy the React frontend using a hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel.  
   - Ensure the frontend points to the production API.

6. **Set Up Domain**  
   - Assign a custom domain to your Azure App Service for the backend.  
   - Configure a custom domain for the frontend on Netlify or Vercel if applicable.

7. **Enable SSL (HTTPS)**  
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled for both the backend and frontend to secure traffic.

8. **Test Live Environment**  
   - Thoroughly test the live environment to ensure both frontend and backend function correctly.

9. **Share Live Link**  
   - Share the live application URL with users for feedback and testing.

This streamlined approach focuses on a single live environment, skipping Docker and staging configurations. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
