Here's a summary of what we just accomplished:

### **Goal:** Set up a user registration and login system using **ASP.NET Core** with **JWT authentication** and a SQL Server database.

---

### **Steps Taken:**

#### **1. Project Setup**
- Verified that **Docker** was running and set up **SQL Server** in a Docker container.
- Configured the connection string for SQL Server in `appsettings.json`.
- Confirmed the connection to SQL Server using **Azure Data Studio**.

---

#### **2. Database Configuration**
- Added **Entity Framework Core** for database management and migrations.
- Set up an `AppDbContext` class to manage database tables (`Users`, `Routines`, `Exercises`, etc.).
- Successfully applied migrations using `dotnet ef migrations` and `dotnet ef database update`.

---

#### **3. User Management**
- Added **ASP.NET Core Identity** to manage users and roles.
- Configured the `IdentityUser` and added authentication and authorization services in `Program.cs`.
- Registered the Identity services with the database context.

---

#### **4. JWT Authentication**
- Configured **JWT authentication** in `Program.cs`:
  - Defined `Jwt:Key`, `Jwt:Issuer`, and `Jwt:Audience` in `appsettings.json`.
  - Implemented JWT token generation in the `AuthController`.

---

#### **5. API Development**
- Created models for **Register** and **Login** with validation attributes.
- Built an `AuthController` with the following endpoints:
  - `POST /api/Auth/signup`: Registers a new user.
  - `POST /api/Auth/login`: Logs in a user and generates a JWT token.
- Tested the endpoints using **Swagger**, confirming that registration works.

---

#### **6. Debugging Issues**
- Resolved issues such as:
  - Port conflicts (e.g., binding to an already-in-use port).
  - Missing service configurations for Identity and JWT.
  - Ensuring the API endpoints were visible in Swagger.

---

### **Outcome**
- A fully functional **user authentication system** with:
  - Registration and login endpoints.
  - JWT tokens for secure API access.
  - SQL Server integration for persistent user data.
  - Swagger integration for easy API testing.

If you need to extend this setup with new features (e.g., password reset, role-based authorization, or additional API endpoints), let me know!
